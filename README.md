The healthcare industry is witnessing rapid advancements with the integration of machine learning
(ML) to enhance diagnostic accuracy. The Predict Care : Chronic Disease Prediction System aims
to leverage ML techniques to predict chronic diseases such as Cancer, Heart Disease, Diabetes,
Parkinson’s Disease, Asthma, and Liver Diseases. The system, built using Django, will provide a
robust and secure platform for healthcare professionals and patients to interact efficiently, ensuring
early detection and better disease management. The objectives of this system include developing a
web-based chronic disease prediction system using ML, implementing user authentication and data
security, automating data preprocessing, generating detailed health reports, and enabling doctorpatient interactions for better healthcare monitoring.
The system will feature secure registration and login for healthcare professionals and patients,
ensuring role-based access control for data privacy. Patients can create and manage profiles,
inputting personal details, medical history, and lifestyle habits such as smoking, alcohol
consumption, and physical activity levels. Data preprocessing will include handling missing values
using mean imputation, feature scaling with Standard Scaler, categorical encoding, and data
validation to enhance model accuracy. The Random Forest Classifier will be used for accurate
disease prediction, analyzing health parameters such as age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol
levels, diabetes indicators, heart rate, obesity status, laboratory test results, existing conditions, and
medications. Predictions for multiple diseases will be available in separate tabs, with datasets
provided for Heart Disease, Diabetes, and Parkinson’s Disease.
The system will generate detailed reports including disease prediction results, confidence scores,
identified risk factors, severity levels, preventive recommendations, treatment plans, and follow-up
schedules. Additionally, doctors will be able to view patient histories, update treatment plans,
schedule appointments, and monitor patient progress in real-time. System administration will
manage user roles, security, and overall system functionality. The expected outcomes include a
fully functional web-based disease prediction system, improved early detection of chronic diseases,
enhanced doctor-patient interactions, and increased awareness of preventive measures. The
technologies used include HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Bootstrap) for frontend, Django (Python) for
backend, PostgreSQL/MySQL for database, Scikit-Learn for ML (Random Forest Classifier), and
security measures such as role-based authentication and data encryption.
In conclusion, the Predict Care : Chronic Disease Prediction System will significantly contribute to
early disease detection and efficient patient management. By leveraging machine learning
algorithms and Django framework, the system will assist doctors in diagnosing diseases efficiently
and recommending appropriate treatments, ultimately improving healthcare outcomes.
